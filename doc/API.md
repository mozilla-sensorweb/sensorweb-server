# SensorWeb API

This document provides protocol-level details of the SensorWeb API.

---

# HTTP API

## URL Structure

All requests will be to URLs of the form:

    https://<host-url>/api/v1/<api-endpoint>

Note that:

* All API access must be over a properly-validated HTTPS connection.
* The URL embeds a version identifier "v1"; future revisions of this API may 
introduce new version numbers.

## Request Format

All POST requests must have a content-type of `application/json` with a 
utf8-encoded JSON body.

### Authentication

Requests that require user authentication must contain a header including a 
signed [JWT](https://jwt.io).

Use the JWT with this header:

```js
{
    "Authorization": "Bearer <jwt>"
}
```

For example:

```curl
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/clients' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJraWQiOm51bGwsImFsZyI6IkhTMjU2In0.eyJpZCI6MiwibmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIn0.JNtvokupDl2hdqB+vER15y89qigPc4FviZfJOSR1Vso'
```

## Response Format
All successful requests will produce a response with HTTP status code of "20X" 
and content-type of "application/json".  The structure of the response body 
will depend on the endpoint in question.

Failures due to invalid behavior from the client will produce a response with 
HTTP status code in the "4XX" range and content-type of "application/json".  
Failures due to an unexpected situation on the server side will produce a 
response with HTTP status code in the "5XX" range and content-type of 
"application/json".

To simplify error handling for the client, the type of error is indicated both 
by a particular HTTP status code, and by an application-specific error code in 
the JSON response body.  For example:

```js
{
  "code": 400, // matches the HTTP status code
  "errno": 777, // stable application-level error number
  "error": "Bad Request", // string description of the error type
  "message": "the value of salt is not allowed to be undefined"
}
```

Responses for particular types of error may include additional parameters.

The currently-defined error responses are:

* status code 400, errno 400: Bad request.
* status code 400, errno 100: Invalid client API name. Missing or malformed 
client API name.
* status code 400, errno 100: Invalid client API redirection URL. Malformed 
client API redirection URL.
* status code 401, errno 401: Unauthorized. If credentials are not valid.
* status code 403, errno 403: Forbidden. The server understood the request, 
but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the request 
SHOULD NOT be repeated.
* status code 500, errno 500: Internal server error.

# API Endpoints

* Login
  * [POST /auth/basic](#post-authbasic)
  * [GET /auth/facebook](#get-authfacebook)
* API clients management
  * [POST /clients](#post-clients) :lock: (admin scope required)
  * [GET /clients](#get-clients) :lock: (admin scope required)
  * [DELETE /clients/:key](#delete-clientskey) :lock: (admin scope required)

## POST /auth/basic
Authenticates a user using Basic authentication. So far only an admin user is 
allowed.
### Request
Requests must include a [basic authorization header]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side) 
with `username:password` encoded in Base64.
```ssh
POST /api/auth/basic HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46QXZhbGlkUGFzc3dvcmQuMA==
```
### Response
Successful requests will produce a "201 Created" response with a session token 
in the form of a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) with the following data:
```json
{
  "id": "admin",
  "scope": "admin"
}
```

The token is provided in the body of the response:

```ssh
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 156
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Fri, 23 Sep 2016 16:22:39 GMT
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6ImFk
            bWluIiwic2NvcGUiOiJhZG1pbiIsImlhdCI6MTQ3NDY0Nzc1O
            X0.R1vQOLVg8A-6i5QaZQVOGAzImiPvgAdkWiODYhYiNn4"
}
```

## GET /auth/facebook
Authenticates a user using his Facebook account.
### Request
Requests must include a JWT signed with a valid client secret as the 
`authToken` query parameter.

```ssh
POST /api/auth/facebook?authToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJjb
GllbnRJZCI6IjEyMzQ1Njc4OTAiLCJzY29wZXMiOlsidXNlci1mYXZvcml0ZXMiXSwiYXV0aFJlZ

sQ2xembu3fyVe-B9bm8mFprwQ HTTP/1.1
```

The payload of the signed JWT must include the following information:
* `id`: client identifier, aka his key.
* `scope`: just `client` for now.
* `redirectUrl`: the URL you would like to be redirected after a
    successful login. This URL needs to be associated with your client
    information first. It will gets the user's JWT as a query parameter `token`.
* `failureUrl` (optional): the URL you would like to be redirected
    after a failure. This URL needs to be associated with your client
    information first.

### Response
A successful request will redirect the user to the Facebook login page, where 
the user should enter her credentials. After a successful login the user 
will eventually be redirected to the URL specified in `redirectUrl` with a 
`token` query parameter containing a session token.

```ssh
https://domain.org/auth/success?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ
jbGllbnRJZCI6IjEyMzQ1NiIsInNjb3BlIjoidXNlciJ9.nU1LD8gyVxd8kjNJhLlEwhUbohVW3TQ1
T5hRvYamAiQ
```

This session token can be used in following requests that require user 
authentication and it is provided in the form of a signed [JWT](https://jwt.io/) 
with the following data:

```json
{
  "id": {
    "opaqueId": "facebook_id",
    "provider": "facebook",
    "clientKey": "02e9c791d7"
