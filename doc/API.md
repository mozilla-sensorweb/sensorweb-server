# SensorWeb API

This document provides protocol-level details of the SensorWeb API.

---

# HTTP API

## URL Structure

All requests will be to URLs of the form:

    https://<host-url>/api/v1/<api-endpoint>

Note that:

* All API access must be over a properly-validated HTTPS connection.
* The URL embeds a version identifier "v1"; future revisions of this API may introduce new version numbers.

## Request Format

All POST requests must have a content-type of `application/json` with a utf8-encoded JSON body.

### Authentication

Requests that require user authentication must contain a header including a signed [JWT](https://jwt.io).

Use the JWT with this header:

```js
{
    "Authorization": "Bearer <jwt>"
}
```

For example:

```curl
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/clients' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJraWQiOm51bGwsImFsZyI6IkhTMjU2In0.eyJpZCI6MiwibmFtZSI6ImFkbWluIn0.JNtvokupDl2hdqB+vER15y89qigPc4FviZfJOSR1Vso'
```

## Response Format
All successful requests will produce a response with HTTP status code of "20X" and content-type of "application/json".  The structure of the response body will depend on the endpoint in question.

Failures due to invalid behavior from the client will produce a response with HTTP status code in the "4XX" range and content-type of "application/json".  Failures due to an unexpected situation on the server side will produce a response with HTTP status code in the "5XX" range and content-type of "application/json".

To simplify error handling for the client, the type of error is indicated both by a particular HTTP status code, and by an application-specific error code in the JSON response body.  For example:

```js
{
  "code": 400, // matches the HTTP status code
  "errno": 777, // stable application-level error number
  "error": "Bad Request", // string description of the error type
  "message": "the value of salt is not allowed to be undefined"
}
```

Responses for particular types of error may include additional parameters.

The currently-defined error responses are:

* status code 400, errno 400: Bad request.
* status code 400, errno 100: Invalid client API name. Missing or malformed client API name.
* status code 400, errno 100: Invalid client API redirection URL. Malformed client API redirection URL.
* status code 401, errno 401: Unauthorized. If credentials are not valid.
* status code 403, errno 403: Forbidden. The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated.
* status code 500, errno 500: Internal server error.
